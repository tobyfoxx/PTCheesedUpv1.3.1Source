The "en" folder name corresponds with the lang value set in english.txt
If you have deutsch.txt with lang = "de" in it, you make a folder called de

The filename of the sprites have to match with the internal sprite name
(You can't add new sprites with this)

By default the sprite origin and size will not change
So export as a sprite sheet, with however many frames you want, but it HAS to be the same size as the original, unless you add extra info into the data.ini:

[sprite_name]
images = <frame count>
xoffset = <horizontal center point>
yoffset = <vertical center point>

If you provide that info it will replace the sprite size, frame count and origin. There are examples in the "en" folder, though you usually wouldn't need to change sprite sizes

You can even make entire Peppino reskin mods, as long as you know how!
